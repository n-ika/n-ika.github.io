This semester, I am teaching LING449N (seminar on speech perception modeling), scheduled Tue/Thu at 12.15-1.45PM. Students will find all the information on ELMS.

Previously, I was a teaching assistant for:
* LING330 - Historical Linguistics (Spring 2022), taught by [Peggy Antonisse](https://blog.umd.edu/peggyantonisse/);
* LING321 - Phonology I (Fall 2021) , taught by [Peggy Antonisse](https://blog.umd.edu/peggyantonisse/).

Some links for students I have found useful during my teaching: 

* Math tutorials (very insightful videos): [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)
* An example of learning Python by [Google](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)
* Easy intro video to [auditory illusions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP9HFcK6YOM)
* Tools similar to Praat: [WaveSurfer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wavesurfer/), [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
* [IPA](https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/) (with sounds, for typing...)
* [Tool for features](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/120a/Pheatures/) by Bruce Hayes
