I am currently (Fall 2021) a teaching assistant for LING321 - Phonology I, taught by [Peggy Antonisse](https://blog.umd.edu/peggyantonisse/).

My regular office hours are **Wednesdays 9.00-11.00AM**. Students can always write to me to arrange a more suitable time. Please specify in advance whether you'd like a zoom or in person meeting.
