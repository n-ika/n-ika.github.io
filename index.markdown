**Dobrodošli!** Welcome!

I am Nika, a first year PhD student at [UMD](https://umd.edu/) in the [Linguistics department](https://ling.umd.edu/), supervised by [Naomi Feldman](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/) and [Bill Idsardi](https://idsardi.wordpress.com/).

I am interested in speech perception, computational phonology and auditory science.

I finished my first Master's double degree in French Studies and Comparative Literature at the [Faculty of Arts in University of Ljubljana, Slovenia](http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/). I did a second Master's degree in [Linguistics in University of Paris, France](http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), supervised by [Ewan Dunbar](http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~edunbar/). I have been mostly interested in speech perception and cognition. My previous work was focused on modelling non native speech perception.
