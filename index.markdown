In Fall 2024, I am excited to join [Jochen Triesch's lab](https://www.fias.science/en/life-and-neurosciences/research-groups/jochen-triesch/) in collaboration with [Julio Hechavarria](https://www.julio-hechavarria.com/) in Frankfurt to computationally model active attention in bats. Starting Fall of September 2025, I will be an assistant professor of [computational linguistics at University of Oregon](https://humanities.uoregon.edu/linguistics).

I just finished my PhD in July 2024 at [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) in the [Linguistics department](https://ling.umd.edu/). My work was primarily advised by [Naomi Feldman](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/) and [Bill Idsardi](https://idsardi.wordpress.com/) on modeling processes of cue weighting in humans and machines. I have also continuously been working with [Thomas Schatz](https://thomas.schatz.cogserver.net/) on perceptual implicit memory of sounds. 
<br>

My broad academic interest is in understanding *how* sound perception happens. This interest comes from the fact that we, humans, are quite good at understanding (and learning) speech. However, the signal carrying it is extremely variable and complex. Additionally, it may be mixed with other sounds that are not the speech we care about in that instant. I use computational models to describe mechanisms that show how to efficiently extract the information encoded in the sound signal, just like we humans do daily, without ever worrying about it. By using models as my research tool, I am building an artificial part of a human mind with a goal of understanding the underlying and still unexplained cognitive mechanisms.

My Master's degrees are in French Studies and Comparative Literature at the [Faculty of Arts in University of Ljubljana, Slovenia](http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) and in [Linguistics (Phonetics and Phonology) in University of Paris, France](http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), where I was advised by [Ewan Dunbar](http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~edunbar/). My work there was focused on modelling non native speech perception.
